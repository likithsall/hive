# Setup Credentials

Interactive credential setup for agents with multiple authentication options. Detects what's missing, offers auth method choices, validates with health checks, and stores credentials securely.

## When to Use

- Before running or testing an agent for the first time
- When `AgentRunner.run()` fails with "missing required credentials"
- When a user asks to configure credentials for an agent
- After building a new agent that uses tools requiring API keys

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Agent

Determine which agent needs credentials. The user will either:
- Name the agent directly (e.g., "set up credentials for hubspot-agent")
- Have an agent directory open (check `exports/` for agent dirs)
- Be working on an agent in the current session

Locate the agent's directory under `exports/{agent_name}/`.

### Step 2: Detect Required Credentials

Read the agent's configuration to determine which tools and node types it uses:

```python
from core.framework.runner import AgentRunner

runner = AgentRunner.load("exports/{agent_name}")
validation = runner.validate()

# validation.missing_credentials contains env var names
# validation.warnings contains detailed messages with help URLs
```

Alternatively, inspect manually:
```python
from aden_tools.credentials import CredentialManager

creds = CredentialManager()

# For tool-based credentials
missing_tools = creds.get_missing_for_tools(agent_tool_names)

# For node-type credentials (e.g., LLM nodes need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
missing_nodes = creds.get_missing_for_node_types(agent_node_types)
```

### Step 3: Present Auth Options for Each Missing Credential

For each missing credential, check what authentication methods are available:

```python
from aden_tools.credentials import CredentialManager

creds = CredentialManager()
auth_options = creds.get_auth_options("hubspot")  # Returns: ['aden', 'direct', 'custom']
setup_info = creds.get_setup_instructions("hubspot")
```

Present the available options using AskUserQuestion:

```
Choose how to configure HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN:

  1) Aden Authorization Server (Recommended)
     Secure OAuth2 flow via integration.adenhq.com
     - Quick setup with automatic token refresh
     - No need to manage API keys manually

  2) Direct API Key
     Enter your own API key manually
     - Requires creating a HubSpot Private App
     - Full control over scopes and permissions

  3) Custom Credential Store (Advanced)
     Programmatic configuration for CI/CD
     - For automated deployments
     - Requires manual API calls
```

### Step 4: Execute Auth Flow Based on User Choice

#### Option 1: Aden Authorization Server

This is the recommended flow for supported integrations (HubSpot, etc.).

**4.1a. Check for ADEN_API_KEY**

```python
import os
aden_key = os.environ.get("ADEN_API_KEY")
```

If not set, guide user to get one:

```python
from aden_tools.credentials import open_browser, get_aden_setup_url

# Open browser to get Aden API key
url = get_aden_setup_url()  # https://integration.adenhq.com/setup
success, msg = open_browser(url)
```

Ask user to provide the ADEN_API_KEY they received.

**4.1b. Save ADEN_API_KEY to Shell Config**

With user approval, persist ADEN_API_KEY to their shell config:

```python
from aden_tools.credentials import (
    detect_shell,
    add_env_var_to_shell_config,
    get_shell_source_command,
)

shell_type = detect_shell()  # 'bash', 'zsh', or 'unknown'

# Ask user for approval before modifying shell config
# If approved:
success, config_path = add_env_var_to_shell_config(
    "ADEN_API_KEY",
    user_provided_key,
    comment="Aden authorization server API key"
)

if success:
    source_cmd = get_shell_source_command()
    print(f"Saved to {config_path}")
    print(f"Run: {source_cmd}")
```

Also save to `~/.hive/configuration.json` for the framework:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

config_path = Path.home() / ".hive" / "configuration.json"
config = json.loads(config_path.read_text()) if config_path.exists() else {}

config["aden"] = {
    "api_key_configured": True,
    "api_url": "https://hive.adenhq.com"
}

config_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
config_path.write_text(json.dumps(config, indent=2))
```

**4.1c. Open Browser for OAuth2 Authorization**

```python
from aden_tools.credentials import open_browser, get_aden_auth_url

# Get integration ID from credential spec
setup_info = creds.get_setup_instructions("hubspot")
provider_name = setup_info["aden_provider_name"]  # "hubspot"

auth_url = get_aden_auth_url(provider_name)  # https://integration.adenhq.com/connect/hubspot
success, msg = open_browser(auth_url)

print("Please complete the OAuth2 authorization in your browser.")
print("Once done, return here to continue.")
```

Wait for user to confirm they've completed authorization.

**4.1d. Sync Credentials from Aden Server**

```python
from core.framework.credentials import CredentialStore
from core.framework.credentials.aden import AdenCredentialClient

store = CredentialStore.with_encrypted_storage()
aden_client = AdenCredentialClient(
    api_url="https://hive.adenhq.com",
    api_key=aden_api_key,
)

# Sync credentials from Aden server
synced = aden_client.sync_to_store(store)
print(f"Synced {len(synced)} credentials from Aden")
```

**4.1e. Run Health Check**

```python
from aden_tools.credentials import check_credential_health

# Get the token from the store
cred = store.get_credential("hubspot")
token = cred.keys["access_token"].value.get_secret_value()

result = check_credential_health("hubspot", token)
if result.valid:
    print("HubSpot credentials validated successfully!")
else:
    print(f"Validation failed: {result.message}")
    # Offer to retry the OAuth flow
```

#### Option 2: Direct API Key

For users who prefer manual API key management.

**4.2a. Show Setup Instructions**

```python
setup_info = creds.get_setup_instructions("hubspot")
print(setup_info["api_key_instructions"])
# Output:
# To get a HubSpot Private App token:
# 1. Go to HubSpot Settings > Integrations > Private Apps
# 2. Click "Create a private app"
# 3. Name your app (e.g., "Hive Agent")
# ...
```

**4.2b. Collect API Key from User**

Use AskUserQuestion to securely collect the API key:

```
Please provide your HubSpot access token:
(This will be stored securely in ~/.hive/credentials)
```

**4.2c. Run Health Check Before Storing**

```python
from aden_tools.credentials import check_credential_health

result = check_credential_health("hubspot", user_provided_token)
if not result.valid:
    print(f"Warning: {result.message}")
    # Ask user if they want to:
    # 1. Try a different token
    # 2. Continue anyway (not recommended)
```

**4.2d. Store in Encrypted Credential Store**

```python
from core.framework.credentials import CredentialStore, CredentialObject, CredentialKey
from pydantic import SecretStr

store = CredentialStore.with_encrypted_storage()

cred = CredentialObject(
    id="hubspot",
    name="HubSpot Access Token",
    keys={
        "access_token": CredentialKey(
            name="access_token",
            value=SecretStr(user_provided_token),
        )
    },
)
store.save_credential(cred)
```

**4.2e. Export to Current Session**

```bash
export HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN="the-value"
```

#### Option 3: Custom Credential Store (Advanced)

For programmatic/CI/CD setups.

**4.3a. Show Documentation**

```
For advanced credential management, you can use the CredentialStore API directly:

  from core.framework.credentials import CredentialStore, CredentialObject, CredentialKey
  from pydantic import SecretStr

  store = CredentialStore.with_encrypted_storage()

  cred = CredentialObject(
      id="hubspot",
      name="HubSpot Access Token",
      keys={"access_token": CredentialKey(name="access_token", value=SecretStr("..."))}
  )
  store.save_credential(cred)

For CI/CD environments:
  - Set HIVE_CREDENTIAL_KEY for encryption
  - Pre-populate ~/.hive/credentials programmatically
  - Or use environment variables directly (HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN)

Documentation: See core/framework/credentials/README.md
```

### Step 5: Record Configuration Method

Track which auth method was used for each credential in `~/.hive/configuration.json`:

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from datetime import datetime

config_path = Path.home() / ".hive" / "configuration.json"
config = json.loads(config_path.read_text()) if config_path.exists() else {}

if "credential_methods" not in config:
    config["credential_methods"] = {}

config["credential_methods"]["hubspot"] = {
    "method": "aden",  # or "direct" or "custom"
    "configured_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
}

config_path.write_text(json.dumps(config, indent=2))
```

### Step 6: Verify All Credentials

Run validation again to confirm everything is set:

```python
runner = AgentRunner.load("exports/{agent_name}")
validation = runner.validate()
assert not validation.missing_credentials, "Still missing credentials!"
```

Report the result to the user.

## Health Check Reference

Health checks validate credentials by making lightweight API calls:

| Credential | Endpoint | What It Checks |
|---|---|---|
| `hubspot` | `GET /crm/v3/objects/contacts?limit=1` | Bearer token validity, CRM scopes |
| `brave_search` | `GET /res/v1/web/search?q=test&count=1` | API key validity |

```python
from aden_tools.credentials import check_credential_health, HealthCheckResult

result: HealthCheckResult = check_credential_health("hubspot", token_value)
# result.valid: bool
# result.message: str
# result.details: dict (status_code, rate_limited, etc.)
```

## Encryption Key (HIVE_CREDENTIAL_KEY)

The encrypted credential store requires `HIVE_CREDENTIAL_KEY` to encrypt/decrypt credentials.

- If the user doesn't have one, `EncryptedFileStorage` will auto-generate one and log it
- The user MUST persist this key (e.g., in `~/.bashrc` or a secrets manager)
- Without this key, stored credentials cannot be decrypted
- This is the ONLY secret that should live in `~/.bashrc` or environment config

If `HIVE_CREDENTIAL_KEY` is not set:
1. Let the store generate one
2. Tell the user to save it: `export HIVE_CREDENTIAL_KEY="{generated_key}"`
3. Recommend adding it to `~/.bashrc` or their shell profile

## Security Rules

- **NEVER** log, print, or echo credential values in tool output
- **NEVER** store credentials in plaintext files, git-tracked files, or agent configs
- **NEVER** hardcode credentials in source code
- **ALWAYS** use `SecretStr` from Pydantic when handling credential values in Python
- **ALWAYS** use the encrypted credential store (`~/.hive/credentials`) for persistence
- **ALWAYS** run health checks before storing credentials (when possible)
- **ALWAYS** verify credentials were stored by re-running validation, not by reading them back
- When modifying `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`, confirm with the user first

## Credential Sources Reference

All credential specs are defined in `tools/src/aden_tools/credentials/`:

| File | Category | Credentials | Aden Supported |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llm.py` | LLM Providers | `anthropic`, `openai`, `cerebras`, `groq` | No |
| `search.py` | Search Tools | `brave_search`, `google_search`, `google_cse` | No |
| `integrations.py` | Integrations | `hubspot` | Yes |

To check what's registered:
```python
from aden_tools.credentials import CREDENTIAL_SPECS
for name, spec in CREDENTIAL_SPECS.items():
    print(f"{name}: aden={spec.aden_supported}, direct={spec.direct_api_key_supported}")
```

## Example Session

```
User: /setup-credentials for my hubspot-agent

Agent: Let me check what credentials your hubspot-agent needs.

[Runs validation, finds ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN missing]

Agent: Your hubspot-agent requires 2 credentials:

  1. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY - Anthropic API key for LLM calls
  2. HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN - HubSpot access token

Let's set these up one at a time.

--- Setting up ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ---

This credential only supports direct API key entry.

[Shows instructions for getting Anthropic API key]
[AskUserQuestion: "Please provide your Anthropic API key:"]
[User provides key]
[Stores in credential store, exports to env]

--- Setting up HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN ---

[AskUserQuestion with 3 options]

Choose how to configure HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN:
  1) Aden Authorization Server (Recommended)
  2) Direct API Key
  3) Custom Credential Store (Advanced)

User: 1 (Aden)

Agent: Great! Let me check if you have an Aden API key configured...

[Checks for ADEN_API_KEY, not found]
[Opens browser to integration.adenhq.com/setup]

Agent: I've opened the Aden setup page. Please sign in and copy your API key.

[AskUserQuestion: "Please provide your Aden API key:"]
[User provides key]

Agent: Would you like me to save this to your shell config (~/.zshrc) for future sessions?

[User approves]
[Saves to ~/.zshrc and ~/.hive/configuration.json]

Agent: Now let's connect your HubSpot account.

[Opens browser to integration.adenhq.com/connect/hubspot]

Agent: Please complete the OAuth2 authorization in your browser, then return here.

[User confirms completion]
[Syncs credentials from Aden server]
[Runs health check]

Agent: HubSpot credentials validated successfully!

All credentials are now configured:
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Stored in encrypted credential store
  - HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN: Connected via Aden OAuth2
  - Validation passed - your agent is ready to run!
```
